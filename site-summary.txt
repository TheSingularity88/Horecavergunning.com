HorecaVergunning is a Dutch hospitality support service that helps venues handle permits, Bibob compliance, legal contracts, and financial administration. The site positions the team as a full-service partner from lease signing through daily operations, with fixed monthly packages instead of hourly billing. It highlights services like permit applications, legal and HR contracts, tax and reporting support, and project management for takeovers or renovations. Visitors are guided to book a free intake, compare pricing tiers, and complete a short permit check quiz to find the right package.
